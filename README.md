## 🛸 THE VISION
This is a high-fidelity, browser-based **Neural Audio-Visual Interface (NAVI)**. Built for the **Epic Tech AI** collective, it transforms raw sonic weaponry into real-time 3D "Liquid Metal" geometry using Three.js and the Web Audio API.

> "Multimedia artist on a mission. Making music, videos, and AI art fueled by cannabis & caffeine. Join the creative chaos."
