# 🌑 DJ SMOKE STREAM: THE NEURAL OVERRIDE INTERFACE

This repository contains the source code for the **AI Lounge After Dark** interactive web experience. Built with **Three.js**, **Web Audio API**, and **Tailwind CSS**, this NAVI (Neural-Audio-Visual Interface) is engineered to surpass standard DJ web presence through high-fidelity "K-Lume" visual synthesis.

## 🚀 Deployment Instructions

### 1. Finalize the Sonic Weaponry
* Export your **432Hz Chrome-Valve Majesty** masterpiece from Suno v5.
* Rename the file to `override.mp3`.
* Place the file in the root directory of this project.
* *(Note: In `main.js`, ensure the `AUDIO_URL` constant is set to `'override.mp3'`)*.

### 2. Configure the Lyric Engine
Open `main.js` and locate the `lyrics` array. Update the `time` (in seconds) and `text` to match your specific **"Hydraulic Tension"** lyrical delivery.

```javascript
const lyrics = [
    { time: 0, text: "System: Optimized." },
    { time: 15, text: "Welcome to [x.com/Sm0ken420](https://x.com/Sm0ken420)" },
    // Add your banger lyrics here...
